# caesar-cipher

In this  project, I implemented a shift cipher function. Each letter in the inputted string is shifted a number of times, according to the number provided by the user. This technique is known as Caesar's code.

Among the programming skills required for this project, I learned:

* How to split a user inputted string into an array

* How to maintain capitalization of words in user inputted string

* To preserve punctuation without breaking my code

* Implement a function to wrap from "z" to "a " and vice versa
